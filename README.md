## üìä Overview
Analyze order data to identify the most and least popular menu items and types of cuisine

## üóÇ Project Structure
- `SQL Query.sql`: Main SQL file containing analysis queries
- `dataset`: Folder With all dataset type
- `Excel analysis.xlsx`: Excel file with query results for easy viewing and further analysis

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
1. SQL Server Database Management System 
2. CSV file viewer
3. Ability to import CSV files into SQL Server
4. ADV SQL knowledge

### Installation Steps
1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/us-baby-names-analysis.git
```

2. Open SQL Server and create a new database RestaurantDB
3. Import dataset into a table

### Viewing Results
- View query results directly in your SQL Server interface
- Export results to Excel for additional analysis
- Use data visualization tools for creating charts and graphs

## üìù Query Highlights

```sql
--find the number of orders
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM order_details
--find the number of items on the menu
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM menu_items

## üìä Output Format
Results will be displayed in organized tables containing:
- Baby name
- Year of record
- Gender
- rnk
- Total births

## üìà Future Enhancements
- Build Power BI dashboard based on SQL outputs.
- Add more filtering options (e.g., state-level trends, gender ratio changes).
- Use stored procedures or views for reusable queries.

## ü§ù Contributing
Contributions are welcome! Here's how you can help:
- Add new analysis queries
- Improve existing queries
- Document results and findings
- Add new visualization examples
